WHMCS - Hetzner widget is a WHMCS widget developed by Hostdog to display your Hetzner servers information.

It features a 10 columns table to display server's:

IP
Server name
Type (Product)
Datacenter
Status
Due Date (next payment date)
Bandwidth In
Bandwidth Out
Bandwidth In & Out Compined
Bandwidth Limit
How to Install

Extract it in WHMCS-PATH/modules/widgets/
Go and setup the widget to appear under Setup -> Administrator Roles
Hetzner has 50 requests per 1 hour limit to the traffic API command, so if you see your bandwidth statistics reset it's because of this limit (or it's just the 1st minute of the month).

This is an open-source software. It is free for download. There is no guarantee or support for it!
